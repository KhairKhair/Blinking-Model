# Blinking-Model
This model consists of a group of follower and a leader (described as Imam in the code) that blink at random times. 
There exists a probability that a follower will change their blinking time to match that of the Imam - probability decreases with row number- 
and when a follower blinks, there is a probability that the adjacent followers will blink.  
The former is called Imam Probability. The variable that controls how much Imam probability decreaese with each row is called Row Multiplier.
The latter is called follower Probability.

This project was inspired by Muslim prayer and synconization of sound during this prayer.
